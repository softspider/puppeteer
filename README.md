## Installation

```sh
yarn
```

Note: When you install Puppeteer, it downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170MB Mac, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Win) that is guaranteed to work with the API. To skip the download, see [Environment variables](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.15.0/docs/api.md#environment-variables).

## Running

```sh
node index
```
